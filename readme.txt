Drop all 3 files into a directory then load up index.cfm , type in a URL press the button. If you don't want web logs showing you tried to download css/js/images from a blocked site then the theory is you click the check boxes. View the code for further comments on what isn't working and needs to be done

This is will work only in Railo 4.0+
The goal if this is so I can access pages blocked by websense or the chinese firewall when I visit China etc
don't mention Tor, proxies etc, if I'm in China I can't look that up, if its a internet cafe I can't change browser settings.
with this I can simply load a blocked pages html like a news article, wikipedia etc.
this is not intended to be fully usable to browse the entire internet.
no license what so ever.
